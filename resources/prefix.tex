%General instructions:
%\begin{itemize}
	%TODO Change here
%	\item The pages in this book are numbered from $1$ to $8$ - please check before you proceed.
%	\item The exam is open-book, open-notes. However you are not allowed to use calculators, cell phones, tablets, computers and other electronic devices. You are NOT allowed to share your resources with anyone else either.
%	\item Read the problem statements carefully - some hints/definitions are also provided in the footnotes. Always provide reason for your answer even
%	when problem doesn't explicitly ask for it.
%	\item Each problem is marked with the points it carries - the exam carries $75$ points. Since you have $90$	minutes, you can spare - on average - $72$ seconds on each point.
	%\item Unless otherwise advised, every graph is {\em a simple graph} i.e. undirected unweighted with no loops and no
	%multiple edges.
%	\item All problems carry equal weight
%	\item Rule 25 applies to all problems in this exam. To use it, you have to write `IDK' against any problem you want to receive $25 \%$ credit for.
%	\item Bonus problems are marked with a double asterisk(**); they are not mandatory and you can't use Rule 25 for them. You are encouraged to attempt them once done with the rest of the problems.
%		\item Provide your name, ID(or roll no), and the location of your current seat in the box below. Your location 		is in the form of $X\times Y$ where $X$ is the row number and $Y$ is the column number.

%    Some general latex examples and examples making use of the
% macros follow.  You may want to latex this file and print out the result
% to get an idea of how things look. (You will need to latex the file twice
% to get the cross-references right.)
%    Even if you already know latex, you should take a few minutes to
% look over these examples, so that you understand the general conventions
% we're using.
