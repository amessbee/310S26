\subsection*{Question 1: \hfill[5]}
Prove or Disprove the following statements\footnote{Note that we say $f(n) = o(g(n))$ if
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 0.
\]
Equivalently, for every constant $c > 0$, there exists $n_0$ such that
$f(n) \le c\, g(n)$ for all $n \ge n_0$. Informally: \textit{$f$ grows strictly slower than $g$}.}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f(n) + g(n) = \Theta(\min(f(n),g(n)))$
\item $f(n) = O(g(n)) \rightarrow \log(f(n)) = O(\log(g(n)))$

\item $f(n) = o(g(n)) \rightarrow \log(f(n)) = o(\log(g(n)))$

\section*{Order Statistics}
The selection problem is to find the $ith$ order statistic of a list. In class, we studied the deterministic linear-time selection algorithm SELECT (also known as Median of Medians).

\subsection*{Question 3: \hfill[5]}
Show how to use SELECT as a subroutine to make Quicksort run in $O(n\log(n))$ time in the worst case, assuming that all elements are distinct. \\
(* Refer to relevant parts of CLRS book for a description of Quicksort).

% \subsection*{Question 7:}
% In the algorithm SELECT, the input elements are divided into groups of 5. Show that the algorithm works in linear time if the input elements are divided into groups of 7 instead of 5. \\
% (* Page 241 of Introduction to Algorithms, Thomas H. Cormen).

\subsection*{Question 4: \hfill[5]}
The SELECT algorithm divides the list into subgroups of size $c$, where $c$ is typically set to $5$. What effect would there be on the algorithm's worst-case run-time if is chosen to be a) less than $5$, b) more than $5$, and c) if $c$ becomes a function of $n$, i.e., $\log n, \sqrt{n}, n/2, n$?


\subsection*{Question 5: \hfill [5]}
Design a linear time algorithm to find all of the $\log n$ smallest integers, {\color{blue} in sorted order}, using the SELECT problem as a subroutine. For example, if we have a list of $n=2^{100}$ integers, then we are interested in the $100$ smallest integers in the given list.

% \subsection*{Question 6:}
% Suppose you have a list $X$ with elements $x_i$, and another list $W$ with weights $w_i$ for each element in $x_i$ in $X$. 
% Design a linear-time algorithm to find an element $x$ with weight $w$ such that the sum of weights of elements less than x is at most 1/2 the total weights, and the sum of weights of elements greater than x is at most 1/2 the total weights. 

% \subsection*{Question 7:}
% Prove that any comparison-based algorithm that finds the median must perform $\Omega(n)$ comparisons in the worst case.
% \\
\section*{Randomized Algorithms}
RANDOMIZED-SELECT is a selection algorithm where pivots are chosen {\em uniformly} at random, unlike the Median of Medians problem which is a deterministic-linear algorithm.
\subsection*{Question 6: \hfill[5]}
Show an example where RANDOMIZED-SELECT has a worst-case run-time of $O(n^2)$

\subsection*{Question 7: \hfill[5]}
Compute the probability that a randomly chosen pivot splits the array into two parts each of size at least $\frac{3n}{10}$. Use this to show that the expected run-time of RANDOMIZED-SELECT is $\Theta(n)$.

\subsection*{Question 8: \hfill[5]}
Suppose we want RANDOMIZED-SELECT to succeed in finding the $k$-th smallest element \emph{without hitting a worst-case path}. If the probability of a good split is $p$, what is the probability that after $t$ independent pivot choices, we always hit good splits?
  



% \section*{Question 3: Dynamic Programming -- Inventory Management (20 marks)}
% A store sells a product over $n$ days. The demand for day $i$ is $d_i$ units. The store can produce up to $P$ units per day. Producing more than $P$ units on any day incurs a penalty of $c$ per extra unit. Additionally, storing inventory costs $h$ per unit per day.

%     \item Define your state, transitions, and base cases clearly.

% \section*{Question 3: Dynamic Programming -- Grid Path with Turns (20 marks)}
% Given an $n \times m$ grid, find the minimum-cost path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell. You may move only right or down. Each move has a cost, and changing direction (e.g., from right to down) adds an extra cost $c$.

%     \item Clearly define the states and transitions.
%     \item Analyze the time complexity.
% \end{itemize}
